cms
===
This is a simple cms application that I use to keep track of the projects I am working on.  The application allows you to create projects and keep track of any issues/enhancements needed by the project.  In addition to using this application to keep track of my simple projects I work on, I am also using it to learn using Codeigniter more.

Libraries Used
--------------
The application uses the following pieces of open source software:
- Codeigniter 1.7.2
- Ion Auth for basic user authentication and user management
- PmWiki for a simple file based wiki
- tinymce for the WYSIWYG
